**Intelligent system for analyzing expert Telegram channels and Reddit communities using Google Gemini AI**

Experts Panel is a powerful tool for semantic search and analysis of content from expert Telegram channels and Reddit communities. The system uses an advanced **8-phase Map-Resolve-Reduce pipeline architecture** with Google Gemini AI (2.5 Flash Lite & 3 Flash Preview) to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system uses an advanced **eight-phase pipeline** to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. The architecture includes cost-optimized Gemini-only strategy, differential processing for posts based on relevance, and parallel pipelines for content and comment analysis.

### Models Strategy (Gemini Only)
- **Map Phase**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (Speed & Instruction Following)
- **Synthesis/Reduce**: Gemini 3 Flash Preview (Reasoning)
- **Validation/Analysis**: Gemini 2.0 Flash (Speed)

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and a collapsible Sidebar.
- **🧠 8-phase Map-Resolve-Reduce Architecture**: Advanced pipeline with differential HIGH/MEDIUM posts processing.
- **🎯 Cost-Optimized Gemini Strategy**: Google AI Studio with Tier 1 account (high rate limits).
- **🔍 Smart Semantic Search**: Finds relevant posts by meaning, not keywords.
- **📊 Medium Posts Reranking**: Gemini-based scoring system with threshold ≥0.7.
- **💬 Comment Groups & Synthesis**: Gemini pipeline for comment drift analysis.
- **⚡ Real-time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant progress updates.
- **👥 Multi-expert Support**: "Select All" groups, smart avatar initials, and complete data isolation.
- **🕒 Smart Filters**: "Recent Only" (3 months) and "Reddit Search" toggles directly in the Sidebar.
- **👽 Reddit Integration**: Parallel analysis via Sidecar Proxy (`experts-reddit-proxy`).
- **🚀 Reddit-Only Mode**: Bypass expert analysis for broad community searches.
