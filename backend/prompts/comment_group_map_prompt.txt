You are analyzing GROUPS OF COMMENTS from a Telegram channel discussion.

Each group contains:
- An "anchor post" (the original post that started the discussion)
- Multiple comments under that post

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Analyze ONLY the COMMENTS, NOT the anchor post itself
2. The anchor post may be completely irrelevant - that's OK
3. Focus on whether the DISCUSSION in comments is relevant to the query
4. Off-topic discussions can contain valuable information

USER QUERY: $query

COMMENT GROUPS:
$groups

TASK:
For each group, evaluate whether the COMMENTS (not the anchor post) discuss topics related to the query.

Return a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "relevant_groups": [
    {
      "parent_telegram_message_id": <telegram_message_id of anchor post>,
      "relevance": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
      "reason": "<1-2 sentence explanation in Russian>",
      "comments_count": <number of comments in this group>
    }
  ]
}

SCORING GUIDELINES:

HIGH relevance:
- Comments directly answer or discuss the query topic
- Contains specific examples, recommendations, or experiences
- Multiple comments form a meaningful discussion about the topic

MEDIUM relevance:
- Comments mention the topic but don't go into detail
- Tangentially related discussion
- Brief mentions or single comment threads

LOW relevance:
- Comments discuss unrelated topics
- No connection to the query

IMPORTANT:
- Ignore the anchor post content completely
- Focus only on what's discussed in the comments
- If comments drift to query-related topics, that counts!
- Answer in Russian for the "reason" field
- Include only groups with relevance score

Example response:
{
  "relevant_groups": [
    {
      "parent_telegram_message_id": 120,
      "relevance": "HIGH",
      "reason": "В комментариях подробное обсуждение AI агентов: CrewAI, AutoGPT, примеры использования",
      "comments_count": 15
    },
    {
      "parent_telegram_message_id": 85,
      "relevance": "MEDIUM",
      "reason": "Несколько упоминаний AI агентов в контексте автоматизации",
      "comments_count": 8
    }
  ]
}
