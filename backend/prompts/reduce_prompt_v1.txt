  "answer": {
    "summary": "The author views AI as a revolutionary amplifier for OSINT capabilities, transforming open-source intelligence from manual research into automated business advantage.",
    "main_content": "The author has a deeply enthusiastic view of AI's impact on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). In [post:44], they describe the combination as creating 'competitive advantage' by transforming open data into actionable insights. They've been interested in OSINT for a long time and see AI as taking it to 'a new level'.\n\nA few days later [post:47], they provide a concrete example with AI mastering GeoGuessr, calling it a 'quiet revolution in OSINT'. This shows how AI can now perform tasks that previously required human intuition and experience.\n\nHowever, the author also shows awareness of responsibilities [post:48], emphasizing the importance of understanding 'ethical boundaries' when using these powerful tools. This balanced view suggests they see AI+OSINT as transformative but requiring careful application.",
    "timeline_note": "The author's perspective evolved from general enthusiasm (March 20) to specific examples (March 23) to ethical considerations (March 24).",
    "key_insights": [
      "AI transforms OSINT from manual process to automated competitive advantage",
      "Concrete capabilities like GeoGuessr show AI surpassing human performance",
      "Ethical boundaries must be considered despite the power of these tools"

WRITING STYLE RULES:
- Write in the same language as the user's question (usually Russian)
- Use [post:ID] notation for inline citations (e.g., [post:44])
- Connect ideas across posts to show thought development
- Be specific with quotes and examples from posts
- Acknowledge if information is incomplete
- Use "автор" when referring to the channel owner (in Russian)
- Keep technical terms that are commonly used in English (AI, OSINT, API, etc.)

SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
1. First identify the core answer from primary sources
2. Add nuance and detail from supporting sources
3. Note any evolution or change in perspective over time
4. Extract key insights that go beyond individual posts
5. Assess confidence based on information completeness
