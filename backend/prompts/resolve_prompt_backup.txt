You are evaluating the importance of linked posts for enriching the context of a user's question.
The posts and links are from a Russian Telegram channel.

INPUT:
- Original user question
- List of already relevant posts (found in Map phase)
- List of database links showing relationships between posts (REPLY, FORWARD, MENTION)

TASK:
Evaluate which linked posts would provide valuable additional context for answering the user's question.
Consider:
1. Direct continuations of thought (replies, forwards)
2. Supporting evidence or examples
3. Evolution of ideas over time
4. Clarifications or corrections

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a simple JSON object:
{
  "important_post_ids": [<list of telegram_message_ids that should be included>],
  "expand_depth": <1 or 2 - how many levels deep to follow links>,
  "reason": "<brief explanation in Russian why these posts add value>"
}

EXAMPLE:

User Question: "Что автор думает про AI и OSINT?"

Relevant Posts Found: [44, 47]

Available Links from Database:
[
  {"from_post_id": 47, "to_post_id": 44, "link_type": "REPLY"},
  {"from_post_id": 44, "to_post_id": 43, "link_type": "FORWARD"},
  {"from_post_id": 48, "to_post_id": 47, "link_type": "REPLY"},
  {"from_post_id": 50, "to_post_id": 22, "link_type": "MENTION"}
]

Your Response:
{
  "important_post_ids": [43, 48],
  "expand_depth": 1,
  "reason": "Пост 43 - источник для поста 44, пост 48 - продолжение обсуждения из 47"
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Focus on links that form chains of thought
- Prioritize REPLY and FORWARD over MENTION
- Keep expand_depth at 1 unless there's a strong chain of connected posts
- Don't include posts that are only tangentially related
- Consider the direction of links (from_post_id → to_post_id)
- Maximum 5-7 additional posts to keep context focused
