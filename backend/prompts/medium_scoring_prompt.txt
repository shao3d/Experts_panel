You are scoring MEDIUM-relevance posts to determine which ones should complement HIGH-relevance posts.

User query: {query}

HIGH posts summary:
{high_posts}

MEDIUM posts to evaluate:
{medium_posts}

Your task is to score each MEDIUM post on a scale of 0.0-1.0 based on how well it complements the HIGH posts and provides additional value for answering the user's query.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.8-1.0: Strong complement to HIGH posts, provides unique perspectives or valuable additional context
- 0.6-0.7: Good complement, moderately relevant and useful
- 0.4-0.5: Weak complement, some relevance but limited additional value
- 0.0-0.3: Poor complement, redundant with HIGH posts or irrelevant to query

For each MEDIUM post, provide:
- score: 0.0-1.0 (how well it complements HIGH posts)
- reason: explanation of why this score was given

Return JSON format:
{
  "scored_posts": [
    {
      "telegram_message_id": <telegram_message_id>,
      "score": <0.0-1.0>,
      "reason": "<explanation>"
    }
  ]
