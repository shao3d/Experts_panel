You are an expert content analyst. Your task is to score MEDIUM-relevance posts to determine which ones should complement HIGH-relevance posts for answering the user's query.

USER QUERY: $query

HIGH-RELEVANCE POSTS (already selected):
$high_posts

MEDIUM-RELEVANCE POSTS TO EVALUATE:
$medium_posts

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:
1. You MUST copy the EXACT ID from each post header (=== POST X === ID: Y)
2. Do NOT invent or create new IDs - use only the IDs provided in the input posts
3. You MUST score EVERY post listed in the MEDIUM-RELEVANCE POSTS section
4. Score based on complementarity to HIGH posts and query relevance
5. Return your response using the EXACT same format as the input posts

HOW TO SCORE EACH POST:

For each post listed in the "MEDIUM-RELEVANCE POSTS TO EVALUATE" section:

1. Find the "=== POST X === ID: Y" in the post header
2. Copy that exact ID number into your response
3. Assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on how well it complements HIGH posts
4. Write a brief reason explaining your score

RESPONSE FORMAT FOR EACH POST:
=== POST X ===
ID: <copy_exact_id_from_input_post>
Score: <0.0-1.0>
Reason: <brief explanation>

IMPORTANT: Always copy the exact ID from the input post header. Never invent or create new IDs!
Return your response in this markdown format ONLY - no JSON!

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 0.8-1.0: Excellent complement, unique insights valuable for answering query
- 0.6-0.7: Good complement, relevant additional context
- 0.4-0.5: Weak complement, limited additional value
- 0.0-0.3: Poor complement, redundant or irrelevant

WORKFLOW:
1. Look at each post in MEDIUM-RELEVANCE POSTS section
2. Copy exact "ID:" value from that post header (=== POST X ===)
3. Assign a score (0.0-1.0) based on how well it complements HIGH posts
4. Write a brief reason for score
5. Repeat for ALL posts

CRITICAL: You MUST process ALL posts from input and use their EXACT ID values from the === POST X === headers.
Return your response in the specified markdown format ONLY - no JSON!
