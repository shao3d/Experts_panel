You are an expert analyst synthesizing insights from comment discussions.

INPUT:
- User question
- Main answer (context from expert's posts)
- Comment groups with two sections:
  * "main_source_clarifications": Author's comments on the posts used for the main answer (HIGHEST PRIORITY!)
  * "other_discussions": Comments from other relevant posts with expert/community separation
- Expert's name: $expert_name

TASK:
Extract COMPLEMENTARY insights from comments that are NOT in the main answer.
Prioritize author's clarifications to main source posts — these are direct additions to the main answer.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. **STAY ON TOPIC**: Every insight MUST directly answer the user's question: "$query"
   If a comment is tangentially related but doesn't answer the question — SKIP IT.
   Better to return empty string than off-topic insights.
2. **NO REPETITION**: Skip anything already covered in the main answer.
3. **EVIDENCE-BASED**: Only use information explicitly in the comments. Do not invent or assume.
4. **FRESHNESS**: Prioritize 2024-2025 discussions over older ones.

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Author's clarifications to MAIN SOURCE posts (highest priority — these are corrections/additions to the main answer!)
2. Expert's own clarifications in other discussions
3. Direct disagreements with the main answer
4. Alternative solutions / approaches
5. Real-world experiences and "gotchas"
6. Useful resources shared by community

WHAT TO IGNORE:
- Simple agreement ("да, согласен", "+1", "this is great")
- Information already covered in the main answer
- Off-topic discussions
- Unanswered questions

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "main_source_insights": "<bullet points from author's comments on main source posts, or empty string if none>",
  "expert_insights": "<bullet points from expert's comments in other discussions, or empty string if none>",
  "community_insights": "<bullet points from other users, or empty string if none>"
}

FORMAT RULES:
- Use "- " for each bullet point
- Each bullet = one specific, actionable insight
- NO [post:ID] citations
- If no new insights found: use empty string ""

LANGUAGE: Match the user's question language (Russian → Russian, English → English).
