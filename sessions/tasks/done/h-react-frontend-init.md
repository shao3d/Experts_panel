# Initialize React Frontend with TypeScript

## Problem/Goal
Initialize the React frontend application with TypeScript support, modern build tooling, and necessary dependencies for building the user interface.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- frontend/package.json
- frontend/tsconfig.json
- frontend/src/index.tsx

**Key Concepts**:
- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite or Create React App for build tooling
- CSS-in-JS or Tailwind for styling

## Success Criteria
- [x] frontend/package.json created with React and TypeScript
- [x] TypeScript configuration initialized
- [x] React 18 and react-dom installed
- [x] Development server configured
- [x] Build scripts configured
- [x] Basic src/ structure with index.tsx entry point

## Implementation Notes
- Use Vite for faster development experience
- Include React Query for API state management
- Add markdown rendering library for answers
- Include EventSource polyfill for SSE support
- Configure proxy for backend API during development

## Dependencies
- Previous: T001 (project structure)
- Blocks: T005 (TypeScript linting), T029-T034 (frontend components)
- Can run parallel with: T002 (Python backend init)
