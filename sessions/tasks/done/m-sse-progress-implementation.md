# Implement SSE Progress Updates

## Problem/Goal
Implement Server-Sent Events progress updates in the query endpoint, connecting the logging service to stream real-time updates to the frontend.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- backend/src/api/query_endpoints.py
- backend/src/services/log_service.py
- backend/src/api/sse.py (SSE utilities)

**Key Concepts**:
- Server-Sent Events implementation
- Progress streaming
- Event formatting
- Connection management

## Success Criteria
- [ ] SSE streaming in query endpoint
- [ ] Connect log service to SSE
- [ ] Format events properly
- [ ] Handle client disconnections
- [ ] Buffer management
- [ ] Event types defined
- [ ] Heartbeat/keepalive
- [ ] Clean connection closure

## Implementation Notes
- Use FastAPI's StreamingResponse
- Format as text/event-stream
- Include event IDs
- Send periodic keepalives
- Handle backpressure
- Clean up on disconnect

## Dependencies
- Previous: T019 (log service), T024 (query endpoint)
- Blocks: Real-time progress display
- Can run parallel with: T035, T037-T040 (other integration tasks)
