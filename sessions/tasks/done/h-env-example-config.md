# Create Environment Configuration Template

## Problem/Goal
Create .env.example file with placeholders for all required environment variables, particularly the OpenAI API key needed for GPT-4o-mini integration.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- .env.example
- backend/src/config.py (optional)

**Key Concepts**:
- Environment variable configuration
- API key security
- Configuration management
- Development vs production settings

## Success Criteria
- [x] .env.example created at project root
- [x] OPENAI_API_KEY placeholder included
- [x] DATABASE_URL configuration (SQLite path)
- [x] Frontend/backend URLs configured
- [x] CORS origins configured
- [x] Clear comments for each variable
- [x] Instructions for obtaining API keys

## Implementation Notes
- Never commit actual .env file
- Include all configuration variables with sensible defaults
- Document required vs optional variables
- Include example values where appropriate
- Consider different environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Dependencies
- Previous: T001 (project structure)
- Blocks: API and service implementations
- Can run parallel with: T004 (Python linting), T005 (TypeScript linting)
