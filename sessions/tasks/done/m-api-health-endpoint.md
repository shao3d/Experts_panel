# Create Health Check Endpoint

## Problem/Goal
Implement GET /health endpoint for monitoring service health, database connectivity, and deployment readiness checks.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- backend/src/api/main.py
- backend/src/api/health.py (optional)

**Key Concepts**:
- Service health monitoring
- Database connectivity check
- Deployment readiness
- Monitoring integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] GET /health endpoint returning 200
- [ ] Database connection check
- [ ] OpenAI API key validation
- [ ] Response time included
- [ ] Version information
- [ ] Memory usage stats (optional)
- [ ] Structured health response
- [ ] Ready vs live endpoints

## Implementation Notes
- Quick response time (<100ms)
- Separate liveness and readiness
- Include service version
- Check critical dependencies only
- Cache health status briefly
- Return JSON with details

## Dependencies
- Previous: T023 (FastAPI main)
- Blocks: Deployment monitoring
- Can run parallel with: T024-T027 (other endpoints)
