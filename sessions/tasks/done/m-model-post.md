# Create Post Model

## Problem/Goal
Implement the Post model with all fields and relationships using SQLAlchemy ORM. This is the core data structure representing Telegram channel posts.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- backend/src/models/post.py
- backend/src/models/__init__.py

**Key Concepts**:
- SQLAlchemy declarative model
- Telegram post structure
- Foreign key relationships
- Text indexing for search

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Post model created with all Telegram fields
- [ ] Primary key (post_id) configured
- [ ] Text content field with appropriate size
- [ ] Timestamp fields (created_at, edited_at)
- [ ] Author/channel information fields
- [ ] Media attachment metadata fields
- [ ] Relationships to Link and Comment models defined
- [ ] Indexes on frequently queried fields

## Implementation Notes
- Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 declarative syntax
- Consider text field size limits
- Add created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Include view count, forward count if available
- Store media as JSON metadata, not binary
- Index text field for full-text search

## Dependencies
- Previous: T002 (Python backend init)
- Blocks: T013 (database schema), T035 (service integration)
- Can run parallel with: T011 (Link model), T012 (Comment model), T014 (JSON parser), T015 (comment collector)
