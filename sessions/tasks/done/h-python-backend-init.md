# Initialize Python Backend

## Problem/Goal
Initialize the Python backend with FastAPI framework, Pydantic v2 for data validation, and SQLAlchemy for database ORM. Set up the requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- backend/requirements.txt
- backend/src/__init__.py

**Key Concepts**:
- FastAPI for high-performance async API
- Pydantic v2 for data validation and serialization
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 for database ORM
- Python 3.11+ compatibility

## Success Criteria
- [x] backend/requirements.txt created with all dependencies
- [x] FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy specified with versions
- [x] Include uvicorn for ASGI server
- [x] Include python-dotenv for environment variables
- [x] Include openai library for GPT-4o-mini integration
- [x] Basic backend/src/ structure initialized

## Implementation Notes
- Use latest stable versions compatible with Python 3.11+
- Include development dependencies (pytest, ruff)
- Pin major versions to avoid breaking changes
- Add aiofiles for async file operations
- Include httpx for async HTTP client

## Dependencies
- Previous: T001 (project structure)
- Blocks: T004 (Python linting), T010-T015 (data layer), T016-T022 (pipeline services), T023-T028 (API layer)
- Can run parallel with: T003 (React frontend init)
