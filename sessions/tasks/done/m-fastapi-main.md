# Create FastAPI Application with CORS Configuration

## Problem/Goal
Set up the main FastAPI application with proper CORS configuration, middleware, and application structure for the API backend.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- backend/src/api/main.py
- backend/src/api/__init__.py

**Key Concepts**:
- FastAPI application setup
- CORS middleware configuration
- API versioning
- Global exception handling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] FastAPI app instance created
- [ ] CORS middleware configured for frontend
- [ ] API version prefix (/api/v1)
- [ ] Exception handlers registered
- [ ] Request logging middleware
- [ ] Health check endpoint included
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation configured
- [ ] Startup/shutdown events

## Implementation Notes
- Allow localhost:3000 for development
- Configure production CORS origins
- Set up request ID tracking
- Include request/response logging
- Configure OpenAPI metadata
- Handle database connection lifecycle

## Dependencies
- Previous: T002 (Python backend init), T013 (database schema)
- Blocks: T024-T028 (all API endpoints)
- Can run parallel with: Frontend components
