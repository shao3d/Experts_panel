# Create Simple Logging Service

## Problem/Goal
Implement a simple logging service for process transparency, enabling real-time progress updates through SSE and debugging of the pipeline execution.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- backend/src/services/log_service.py
- backend/src/services/__init__.py

**Key Concepts**:
- Process transparency
- Real-time progress updates
- SSE event streaming
- Structured logging

## Success Criteria
- [ ] LogService class with event methods
- [ ] Log pipeline phase transitions
- [ ] Track processing metrics
- [ ] Format logs for SSE streaming
- [ ] Support different log levels
- [ ] Include timestamps and context
- [ ] Buffer management for streaming
- [ ] JSON-formatted log entries

## Implementation Notes
- Use Python logging with custom handlers
- Structure logs for easy parsing
- Include request ID for tracking
- Support both file and stream output
- Track performance metrics
- Enable/disable verbose mode

## Dependencies
- Previous: Basic project setup
- Blocks: T036 (SSE implementation)
- Can run parallel with: T016-T018, T020-T022 (other services and prompts)

## Work Log
### 2025-09-26 - Task Migration
- Migrated from specs/001-telegram-map-resolve/tasks.md (Original: T019)
- Priority set to high (core pipeline component)
