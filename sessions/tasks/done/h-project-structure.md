# Create Project Structure

## Problem/Goal
Create the foundational project directory structure per the implementation plan, establishing separate backend/, frontend/, data/, and prompts/ directories to organize the codebase.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- backend/ (directory)
- frontend/ (directory)
- data/ (directory)
- prompts/ (directory)

**Key Concepts**:
- Separation of concerns between backend/frontend
- Dedicated data directory for exports and database
- External prompts directory for LLM templates

## Success Criteria
- [x] backend/ directory created at project root
- [x] frontend/ directory created at project root
- [x] data/ directory created at project root
- [x] prompts/ directory created at project root (note: backend/prompts/ for backend-specific prompts)
- [x] Basic subdirectory structure initialized

## Implementation Notes
- Follow standard Python/React project conventions
- Ensure clear separation between backend API and frontend UI
- Data directory will hold Telegram exports and SQLite database
- Prompts directory allows easy experimentation with LLM templates

## Dependencies
- Previous: None (first task)
- Blocks: T002-T044 (all subsequent tasks)
- Can run parallel with: None (foundational task)

## Work Log
### 2025-09-26 - Task Migration
- Migrated from specs/001-telegram-map-resolve/tasks.md (Original: T001)
- Priority set to high (critical setup task)

### 2025-09-27 - Task Completed
- Created backend/ directory with src/ subdirectories (api, models, services, data)
- Created backend/tests/validation/ for Q&A test scenarios
- Created frontend/ directory with src/ subdirectories (components, pages, services, types)
- Created frontend/public/ for static assets
- Created data/ directory with exports/ subdirectory for Telegram JSON files
- Verified prompts/ directory already exists with LLM templates
- All success criteria met
- Committed changes in branch feature/project-structure
