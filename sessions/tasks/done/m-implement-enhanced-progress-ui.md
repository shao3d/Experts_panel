# Enhance Progress UI with Better User Feedback

## Problem/Goal
Users currently see basic progress information but lack detailed understanding of what's happening during processing. The goal is to enhance the ProgressSection component with:
1. Visual indication when processing takes longer than expected
2. Contextual information about what each phase is actually doing
3. Real-time statistics during processing (number of active experts)
4. Better visual feedback for hanging processes

## Success Criteria
- [x] User sees warning indicator when any phase exceeds 180 seconds
- [x] Active phase shows contextual description (e.g., "Searching relevant posts...")
- [x] Real-time expert count displays during processing
- [x] All improvements fit within existing UI space constraints
- [x] No breaking changes to existing progress flow
- [x] Enhanced information appears only when processing is active

## Context Manifest

### How Progress UI Currently Works: Multi-Expert Pipeline with SSE Streaming

The Experts Panel uses a sophisticated eight-phase processing pipeline with real-time progress tracking via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Here's the complete flow:

**Initial Request Flow:**
When a user submits a query through `QueryForm.tsx`, the request goes to `App.tsx` which:
1. Calls `apiClient.submitQuery()` with `stream_progress: true`
2. Sets `isProcessing={true}` and clears previous progress events
3. Receives SSE events through the `parseSSEStream()` function in `services/api.ts`
4. Updates `progressEvents` array state via progress callback
5. Passes events to `ProgressSection` component for real-time display

**SSE Event Generation & Flow:**
The backend `simplified_query_endpoint.py` generates progress events through:
- **Multi-Expert Parallel Processing**: All experts processed simultaneously with individual progress tracking
- **Event Types**: `phase_start`, `progress`, `phase_complete`, `expert_complete`, `complete`, `error`
- **Event Structure**: Each `ProgressEvent` contains `event_type`, `phase`, `status`, `message`, `timestamp`, and optional `data` with `expert_id`
- **Queue-Based Streaming**: Events flow through `asyncio.Queue` with 100-event buffer to prevent memory leaks

**Current ProgressSection Implementation:**
The `ProgressSection.tsx` component currently provides:
1. **Phase Tracking**: Fixed phases array (`map`, `resolve`, `reduce`, `comment_groups`) with icons and status
2. **Timer**: Basic elapsed seconds counter starting when `isProcessing={true}`
3. **Phase Status Logic**: `getPhaseStatus()` determines 'pending'/'active'/'completed' by filtering events by phase name
4. **Statistics Display**: Shows `totalPosts`, `processingTime`, and `expertCount` after completion
5. **Visual Indicators**: Uses colors (completed=green, active=blue, pending=gray) and icons

**Progress Event Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface ProgressEvent {
  event_type: 'phase_start' | 'progress' | 'phase_complete' | 'complete' | 'error';
  phase: string;                    // map/resolve/reduce/comment_groups/etc.
  status: string;                   // processing/completed/failed/etc.
  message: string;                  // Human-readable progress message
  timestamp?: string;               // ISO timestamp
  data?: Record<string, any>;       // Contains expert_id, processing details
}
```

**Multi-Expert Context:**
- Parallel processing of all experts in database (refat, ai_architect, neuraldeep)
- Each expert generates separate progress events with `expert_id` in data
- Frontend receives interleaved events from all experts
- Current UI shows consolidated progress, not per-expert breakdown

**Backend Pipeline Phases:**
1. **Map Phase** - Qwen 2.5-72B finds relevant posts (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW classification)
2. **Medium Scoring Phase** - Scores Medium posts (≥0.7 threshold → top-5 selection)
3. **Differential Resolve Phase** - HIGH posts get linked context, selected Medium posts bypass
4. **Reduce Phase** - Gemini 2.0 Flash synthesizes answer
5. **Language Validation Phase** - Qwen 2.5-72B validates language consistency
6. **Comment Groups Phase** - GPT-4o-mini finds relevant discussions (optional)
7. **Comment Synthesis Phase** - Gemini 2.0 Flash extracts insights

**Current UI Integration & Styling:**
- **Layout**: ProgressSection occupies right half of top section (140px height container)
- **Parent Container**: Styled with white background, border, flex layout
- **Typography**: System fonts, consistent sizes (14px for labels, 20px for stats)
- **Color Scheme**: Blue (#0066cc) for active, green (#28a745) for completed, gray (#adb5bd) for pending
- **Inline Styles**: No CSS framework, all styling via style objects
- **Responsive Design**: Fixed container dimensions, flex-based layouts

**Expert Count Tracking:**
The system tracks expert count through:
- **Backend**: Parallel processing of all experts, each with unique `expert_id`
- **Event Data**: Progress events include `expert_id` in `data` field
- **Frontend**: `App.tsx` calculates `expertCount` from `expertResponses.length`
- **Current Display**: Shows in stats after completion, not during processing

**Timer Implementation:**
Current timer logic:
- Starts when `isProcessing={true}` and `startTime` is null
- Updates every 1000ms via `setInterval`
- Resets when processing completes or stops
- Displays as `({elapsedSeconds} seconds)` next to phase indicators

### For Enhanced Progress UI Implementation: Warning Indicators & Contextual Feedback

Since we're enhancing the ProgressSection with better user feedback, the integration points are:

**Warning Indicator (180+ seconds):**
- The existing `elapsedSeconds` state provides the foundation
- Need to add warning state when `elapsedSeconds >= 180`
- Should show visual indicator (orange color, warning icon) without breaking existing layout
- Must integrate with existing phase display without expanding container height

**Contextual Phase Descriptions:**
- Current `getPhaseStatus()` function can be extended to provide descriptions
- Need mapping from phase names to user-friendly descriptions in English
- Should appear near existing phase indicators without disrupting layout
- Must respect existing space constraints (140px container height)

**Real-time Expert Count:**
- Currently only shows after completion via `stats.expertCount`
- Need to extract expert count from `progressEvents` during processing
- Progress events contain `expert_id` in `data` field for active tracking
- Should display count of currently processing experts, not total experts

**Visual Feedback for Hanging Processes:**
- Existing timer provides base for detecting slow operations
- Need enhanced visual states for long-running phases
- Should use existing color scheme with additional warning colors
- Must maintain clean, professional appearance consistent with current design

**Space Constraints & Layout:**
- **Fixed Height**: 140px top section container cannot expand
- **Existing Elements**: QueryForm (left half), ProgressSection (right half)
- **Current Density**: Phase indicators + timer + stats already fill space efficiently
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Enhance existing elements rather than adding new ones

**Multi-Expert Considerations:**
- Progress events come from multiple experts simultaneously
- Need to aggregate expert information across events
- Should show active expert count during processing
- Must handle expert-specific events gracefully

**Error Handling Integration:**
- Existing error handling shows generic error messages
- Enhanced UI should maintain graceful degradation
- Warning indicators should not interfere with error display
- Must preserve existing error state management

### Technical Reference Details

#### Component Interfaces & Signatures

**ProgressSection Props:**
```typescript
interface ProgressSectionProps {
  isProcessing: boolean;
  progressEvents: ProgressEvent[];
  stats?: {
    totalPosts: number;
    processingTime: number;
    expertCount?: number;
  };
}
```

**ProgressEvent Structure:**
```typescript
interface ProgressEvent {
  event_type: 'phase_start' | 'progress' | 'phase_complete' | 'complete' | 'error';
  phase: string;                    // Current processing phase
  status: string;                   // Status within phase
  message: string;                  // Human-readable message
  timestamp?: string;               // Event timestamp
  data?: Record<string, any>;       // Includes expert_id for multi-expert
}
```

#### Current State Management

**ProgressSection Internal State:**
```typescript
const [startTime, setStartTime] = React.useState<number | null>(null);
const [elapsedSeconds, setElapsedSeconds] = React.useState(0);
```

**App.tsx State Management:**
```typescript
const [isProcessing, setIsProcessing] = useState(false);
const [progressEvents, setProgressEvents] = useState<ProgressEvent[]>([]);
const [expertResponses, setExpertResponses] = useState<ExpertResponseType[]>([]);
```

#### Phase Configuration

**Current Phase Definitions:**
```typescript
const phases = [
  { name: 'map', label: 'Map', icon: '🔍' },
  { name: 'resolve', label: 'Resolve', icon: '🔗' },
  { name: 'reduce', label: 'Reduce', icon: '⚡' },
  { name: 'comment_groups', label: 'Comments', icon: '💬' }
];
```

#### Data Structures

**Progress Event Flow:**
1. Backend generates events with `expert_id` in data field
2. SSE stream delivers events in real-time
3. Frontend accumulates events in `progressEvents` array
4. `ProgressSection` filters events by phase to determine status

**Expert Count Extraction:**
```typescript
// Extract active expert IDs from progress events
const activeExperts = new Set();
progressEvents.forEach(event => {
  if (event.data?.expert_id && event.event_type !== 'complete') {
    activeExperts.add(event.data.expert_id);
  }
});
const expertCount = activeExperts.size;
```

#### Configuration Requirements

**Timing Thresholds:**
- **Warning Threshold**: 180 seconds (3 minutes) for processing time
- **Timer Update Interval**: 1000ms (1 second)
- **SSE Event Buffer**: 100 events max (backend)

**Color Scheme Extensions:**
- **Warning Color**: Orange (#ff9800) for 180+ second indicators
- **Existing Colors**:
  - Active: #0066cc (blue)
  - Completed: #28a745 (green)
  - Pending: #adb5bd (gray)
