# Create Comprehensive Test Queries

## Problem/Goal
Create comprehensive test queries with expected posts for end-to-end validation of the Map-Resolve-Reduce pipeline. These serve as the primary validation mechanism per the constitution.

## Context Manifest
**Key Files**:
- backend/tests/validation/test_queries.yaml

**Key Concepts**:
- End-to-end pipeline validation
- Q&A test sets (not unit tests)
- Expected posts documentation
- Performance benchmarking queries

## Success Criteria
- [ ] test_queries.yaml with 5-10 comprehensive queries
- [ ] Mix of simple and complex queries
- [ ] Expected post IDs for each query
- [ ] Expected answer characteristics documented
- [ ] Performance targets defined (<3 minutes)
- [ ] Edge cases and corner cases included

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on completeness over precision (MVP goal)
- Include queries that test all three phases
- Document reasoning for expected results
- Include queries from real use cases
- Consider multilingual content if present

## Dependencies
- Previous: T001 (project structure)
- Blocks: T041 (performance validation), T043 (quickstart validation)
- Can run parallel with: T007 (topic search), T008 (reference follow)
