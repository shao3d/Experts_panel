Из логов видно, что:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **neuraldeep** - retry работает хорошо (множественные ошибки исправлены)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **ai_architect** - неясно, сработал ли retry для JSON decode error\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **refat** - retry работает\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nНужно проверить код реализации retry - он экспертно-зависимый или универсальный? Возможно, neuraldeep получил более надежную реализацию retry, а другие эксперты - нет.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nЭто может объяснять, почему neuraldeep успешно завершил с 10 HIGH постами, а другие эксперты могли потерять важные чанки и не найти релевантный контент.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nСтоит проверить `map_service.py` - как реализован retry механизм для разных экспертов.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   192→      }\\\\\\\\n   193→    ]\\\\\\\\n   194→  },\\\\\\\\n   195→  {\\\\\\\\n   196→    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n   197→    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Да.
