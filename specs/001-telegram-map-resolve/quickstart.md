## 6. Test the System

### Example Query 1: Topic Search

- RESOLVE: Discovers post 47 links to 44, adds both
- REDUCE: Synthesizes comprehensive answer
- Time: ~2-3 minutes
```

### Example Query 2: Follow References
```
Question: "Tell me about getting resources for startups"

Expected behavior:
- MAP: Finds posts 22 and 43 about startup resources
- RESOLVE: Discovers they form a series, includes both
- REDUCE: Presents complete guide from both parts
```

## 7. Understanding the Process Log

The interface shows real-time progress:

```
üîç Analyzing your question...

üìä MAP phase (parallel search):
  ‚úì Chunk 1-30: found 2 relevant posts (#7, #12)
  ‚úì Chunk 31-60: found 1 post (#44)
  ‚úì Chunk 61-90: found 3 posts (#67, #71, #89)
  ‚úì Chunk 91-120: no relevant posts

üîó RESOLVE phase (enrichment):
  ‚Üí Post #44 links to #47 - adding
  ‚Üê Post #7 is referenced by #9 - adding
  Depth 2: No new links found

‚ú® REDUCE phase (synthesis):
  Generating comprehensive answer...

```

## Troubleshooting

### "No posts found"

- Verify data import was successful

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- OpenAI API limits reached
- Wait a few minutes
- Check API usage dashboard
