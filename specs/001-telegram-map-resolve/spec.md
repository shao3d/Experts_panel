# Feature Specification: Intelligent Telegram Channel Analysis System

**Feature Branch**: `001-telegram-map-resolve`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Интеллектуальная система анализа Telegram каналов с архитектурой Map-Resolve-Reduce для полного контекстного поиска"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user interested in understanding an expert's thoughts from their Telegram channel, I want to ask natural language questions about the channel's content and receive comprehensive, well-sourced answers that capture the complete context of the author's ideas, including how their thoughts evolved over time and relate to each other.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Telegram channel with 100-300 posts exported as JSON, **When** the user asks "What does the author think about OSINT and AI?", **Then** the system returns a synthesized answer combining all relevant posts with expandable source references

2. **Given** posts with internal cross-references (post A links to post B which links to post C), **When** the user asks about topic in post A, **Then** the system automatically includes context from linked posts B and C in the answer

3. **Given** posts with user comments added manually, **When** viewing source posts in the answer, **Then** each post can be expanded to show associated comments

4. **Given** a question asked to the system, **When** the user submits it, **Then** the system processes it fresh through all phases to ensure accuracy (no caching in MVP)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no relevant posts are found for a query?
  → System returns a clear message stating no relevant content was found
- How does system handle circular references between posts (A→B→A)?
  → System detects cycles and stops after processing each unique post once
- What happens when the exported JSON is malformed or incomplete?
  → System validates JSON structure on import and reports specific issues

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process Telegram channel exports in JSON format containing posts, dates, and text entities
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and preserve all internal links between posts (t.me/channel/ID format)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to ask questions in natural language through a web interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST process queries using three distinct phases: Map (parallel search), Resolve (context enrichment via DB links), and Reduce (synthesis)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display real-time progress during query processing showing each phase's status
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide complete source traceability - every answer links to specific posts used
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to expand answer sources to view full post content
- **FR-008**: System MUST support interactive addition of comments to posts during data preparation
- **FR-009**: System MUST process each query fresh without caching to ensure accuracy in MVP
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle channels with 100-300 posts efficiently
- **FR-011**: System MUST follow linked posts up to 2 levels deep (A→B→C) during context enrichment
- **FR-012**: System MUST process posts in configurable chunks (default 30 posts per chunk)
- **FR-013**: System MUST store all post relationships as first-class entities for efficient traversal

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Post**: Represents a single Telegram channel message with content, date, author, and optional comments
- **Link**: Represents a connection between two posts (internal references within the channel)
- **Query**: A user's natural language question about the channel content
- **Answer**: Synthesized response combining relevant posts with source attribution
- **Comment**: User-added annotation to a post providing additional context
